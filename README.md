### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ⚡ Addicted to Kakegurui. More specfically to Kirari Momobami.
- ⚡ I write some code, like to learn new technologies and old ones as well.
- ⚡ Don't judge me for this repository, some projects were made a long time ago or really really fast. But all of them work properly.
